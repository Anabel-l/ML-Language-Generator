# ML-Language-Generator

Ok so concept of this one: generate a language (using adapted code from LanguageGames)
Then each word is associated with an English word, and we train an RNN on this data,
so when you want to translate a given word, it uses the RNN to pick the most accurate word.
This is to try and account for conjugations of words and such things.
